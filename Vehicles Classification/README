Data Set
---------------------------------------
The purpose of the case study is to classify a given silhouette as one of three different types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Chevrolet van,
Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with
the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but
it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.


---Approach--
1- Using EDA/Statistical Tests post modifying the features to ensure it still remains from the same sample
2- Outlier Handling
3- PCA
4- SVM and crossvalidation technique.
